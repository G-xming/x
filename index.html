        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">Games I Love/Recommend:</h1>
        <h3>1. Shale Hill Secrets - This was just an awesome game, and its very well made. I am hoping there is more coming soon. It really had its own story seperate from other AVNs. I definately recommand this for sure, and I also recommend you to support them on Patreon <a href="https://www.patreon.com/lovejoint">(click me)</a></h3>
		<h3>2. Being A DIK Season 1 - Good game, has interactive minigames, not all about sex either, love it. Multiple options in the game, and they actually impact the story, I totally recommend this! Support them on Patreon! <a href="https://www.patreon.com/runey">(click me)</a>
		<h3>3. Ripples - An Incredible RenPy game, which has its own distinguished plotline, that seperates it from other AVNs that soley focus on sex. This game is well made and I recommend this. Support them on Patreon as well <a href="https://www.patreon.com/jestur">(click me)</a></h3>

        <h3>5. Koikatu/Koikatsu - Great Game, well made with interaction rather than it just simply being a visual novel. I recommend this to anyone who wants to do more then just click from options!
